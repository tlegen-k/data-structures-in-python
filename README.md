# data-structures-in-python
This repo contains my implementation of data structures in Python. 
Unit tests to check correctness are in files `test_*.py`
Data structures implemented:
1. Binary tree
2. Linked list
3. Circular list
4. Doubly linked list
5. Queue
6. Stack

It is work in progress as I continue preparing for coding interviews, so the repo wil be updated as well.
